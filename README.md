## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building for Production

```bash
bun build index.ts --target node --outfile dist/index.js
```

### Using Your Own Discord Application

1. Create a new application at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Copy your Client ID
3. Replace the `clientId` in `server/config.ts`
4. Upload custom assets for your Rich Presence display

### Custom Site Icons

Web Presence now supports custom icons for popular websites. When you visit a supported site, the Discord presence will show a site-specific icon instead of the generic web icon.

#### Automatic Icon Collection

We've included a script to automatically download icons for all the websites listed in `siteIcons.ts`:

```bash
cd scripts
npm install
npm run collect-icons
```

This script will:

1. Parse all domains from `siteIcons.ts`
2. Download icons from multiple sources
3. Process them to the correct size and format
4. Save them to the `assets/site-icons` directory
5. Generate a report of successful and failed downloads

For icons that couldn't be automatically downloaded, the script also generates a helper HTML file to assist with manual collection.

#### Adding Icons to Discord

Once you have the icons:

1. Go to your application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Navigate to the "Rich Presence" > "Art Assets" section
3. Upload your icons with names matching the `iconKey` values in `server/siteIcons.ts`
4. For example, upload an icon named `youtube` for YouTube, `github` for GitHub, etc.

The default configuration includes mappings for the most popular websites that users would want to show in their Discord presence, focusing on development, gaming, and entertainment sites. You can customize this list by editing the `siteIcons.ts` file.

### Contributing Icons

We welcome contributions of new site icons! If you'd like to add support for more websites:

1. Create a 512x512 PNG icon for the website
2. Add it to the `assets/site-icons` directory
3. Update the `server/siteIcons.ts` file with the new website entry
4. Submit a pull request

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed guidelines.
