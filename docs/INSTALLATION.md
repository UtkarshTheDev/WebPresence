  <p><i>Follow this step-by-step guide to get Web Presence up and running</i></p>
</div>

This comprehensive guide will walk you through installing Web Presence from start to finish, with detailed instructions for both beginners and advanced users.

## üìã What You'll Need

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Discord desktop app installed and running
- A web browser (Chrome or Firefox)
- Basic knowledge of using the command line (for server installation)

## üîç Overview of Installation Process

Web Presence consists of two main components:

1. **Server**: Connects to Discord and updates your presence
2. **Browser Extension**: Sends your current website to the server

Both components need to be installed for Web Presence to work properly.

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 1: Install the Server

The server is the part that connects your browser to Discord. You have two options:

### Option A: Using npm package (Recommended for beginners)

This is the easiest way to install Web Presence.

<details open>
<summary><b>Step-by-step instructions</b></summary>

1. **Install Node.js** (version 16 or higher)

   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (choose the "LTS" version)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
   - To verify installation, open a terminal/command prompt and type:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - You should see a version number like `v16.15.0` or higher

2. **Install the Web Presence package globally**

   ```bash
   npm install -g webpresence
   ```

   This command installs the Web Presence server on your computer so it can be run from anywhere.

3. **Start the server in daemon mode** (recommended)

   ```bash
   webpresence start -d
   ```

   You should see a message indicating the server has started successfully.

4. **Configure autostart** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   webpresence autostart --enable
   ```

   This makes Web Presence start automatically when you turn on your computer.

5. **Verify the server is running**

   ```bash
   webpresence status
   ```

   You should see a message confirming the server is running and connected to Discord.

</div>

> **What is daemon mode?**
>
> Daemon mode (using the `-d` flag) runs the server in the background, so you can close your terminal window and the server will keep running. This is the recommended way to run Web Presence.
>
> **What is autostart?**
>
> Autostart configures Web Presence to start automatically when your computer boots up, ensuring Discord presence is always available without manual intervention. See the [Autostart Configuration](./AUTOSTART.md) guide for more details.

### Option B: Installing from source code

If you want to modify the code or contribute to the project, you can install from source:

<details>
<summary><b>Step-by-step instructions for developers</b></summary>

1. **Install Git** (if not already installed)

   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

2. **Clone the repository**

   - Open a terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to where you want to download the code

3. **Install and start the server**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server in the foreground. Keep the terminal window open while using Web Presence.
